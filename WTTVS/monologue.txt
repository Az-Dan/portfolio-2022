She opened her mouth.

"I do not claim to have been a perfect woman, before I shed such a form... but I saw something, all those years ago in Tokyo. 
Something that I knew only I had the strength to act upon. 
Only I could lead them to lift their heads, to rebel rather than perish like sheep. 
And in the smoldering ashes of the old, rotten world, I sought to create a new one. 
One where human and Persona could live together, bound by the laws of nature, not of man."

"But now... I see before me five fools who wish to challenge that vision. 
In many ways, you already have: making a mockery out of the trials I set upon you, corrupting the mind of one of my greatest champions... 
I can sense it. Each and every one of you... poisoned. Poisoned by higher powers who only seek to use you as puppets for their own gains."

"I ask once more, for the sake of this world. Lay down your arms, and join me. 
Or, if you choose to continue your insolence... I will not hesitate to cut you down with my fullest strength."
