equation.py (2021-present): My (work-in-progress) revamp to my old RPG damage calculator, emulating the damage system in the Persona/Shin Megami Tensei video game series. The final product will recognize inputted moves by name ('Agidyne' = strong fire attack, 'Mabufu' = weak AoE ice attack, etc.), without manual inputs as with the old equation.

equationold.java (2020-2021): The old RPG damage calculator, as mentioned above. Requires the user to manually input attack values, statistics, etc. before producing a final value. Tweaked throughout quarantine/virtual schooling and used over the course of 3 campaigns. To be phased out (see above).
