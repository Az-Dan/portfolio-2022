*MarkusBot* (2022-present): A Discord bot, assembled so as to 'trim the fat' in terms of features of provide only necessary functions (music, dice rolling, etc.) for a private server I moderate. Credit to [Adrian Clayton](https://github.com/KKITAANIK) and [TannerGabriel](https://github.com/TannerGabriel/) for the original code(s), and special thanks to [Pebblehost](https://pebblehost.com/) for compiling/hosting it all.

*equation.py* (2021-present): My (work-in-progress) revamp to my old RPG damage calculator, emulating the damage system in the Persona/Shin Megami Tensei video game series. The final product will recognize inputted moves by name ('Agidyne' = strong fire attack, 'Mabufu' = weak AoE ice attack, etc.), without manual inputs as with the old equation.

*equationold.java* (2020-2021): The old/soon-to-be-obsolete RPG damage calculator, as mentioned above. Requires the user to manually input attack values, statistics, etc. before producing a final value. Tweaked throughout quarantine/virtual schooling and used over the course of 3 campaigns. To be phased out (see above).
